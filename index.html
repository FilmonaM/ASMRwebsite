                    <p>The Black Power Movement emerged in the mid-1960s as a revolutionary force demanding self-determination, cultural pride, and an end to systemic oppression. It wasn't just political—it was cultural, artistic, and sonic.</p>
                    <p>While the Civil Rights Movement sought integration through peaceful protest, Black Power demanded liberation by any means necessary. This radical shift needed a soundtrack equally fierce, uncompromising, and electric.</p>

                <p>Rock and roll was born from the blues, gospel, and rhythm of Black America. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Chuck Berry, Little Richard—they created the sound that would shake the world.</p>
                <p>By the late 60s, Black artists reclaimed rock as a weapon of resistance. The distortion wasn't just sound—it was rage. The volume wasn't just loud—it was a declaration. The lyrics weren't just words—they were revolution.</p>
                <p>While mainstream America tried to whitewash rock, Black Power artists electrified it with purpose, turning amplifiers into megaphones for liberation.</p>

                        <p>The feedback screams like sirens. The wah-wah pedal cries like mothers. The drums pound like boots on pavement. Without singing a single word about politics, Hendrix created the most visceral anti-war statement in rock history.</p>
                        <p>This was protest through pure sound—making white America feel the violence they exported and inflicted.</p>

                        <p>"Politicians In My Eyes" strips rock to its bones—pure velocity, pure anger. The lyrics spit truth about government lies and corruption with no metaphors, no poetry, just fury.</p>
                        <p>Ignored for decades, Death's music proved that Black artists weren't just part of punk's story—they wrote the first chapter. Their rejection by labels wasn't about the music; it was about an industry that couldn't imagine Black punk.</p>

                        <p>Sly Stone didn't just integrate his band—he created a musical United Nations that showed what America could be while calling out what it was. This song was a sonic confrontation, putting racism's ugliest word in the title and on the radio.</p>
                        <p>The track pulses with funk-rock fusion, but the message is pure revolution. The call-and-response format turns slurs into a dialogue about power, making white audiences confront their complicity.</p>
